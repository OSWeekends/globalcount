Global Counter
===================

Easy to use counter for various people, any person can connect to your server and count people, eggs, and open source projects if you want.

###To run:
 - Just type : 
   -"npm install"
   -"npm start" in the root folder

###Made thinking on:

 - People that need to control capacity of one space with more than one access that doesn't have automatic control.
 - Put a person with this webapp in a mobile or tablet in each access and let them how many people is going in (pressing +) or how many are leaving (pressing -).
 - It has a "put to 0" the count with an alert.


###Future changes
 - Alert button in case the place can be dangerous.
 - Implement a "capacity" button when approaching to that number change color, or make an alert sound (user choice).
 - Can't think in more useful functions right now.
